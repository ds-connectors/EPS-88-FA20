    "1. **Were the winds stronger in January or July?** The 'HLY-WIND-VCTSPD' column provides the vector speed\n",
    "    - Make histograms of the wind speeds in each month.\n",
    "    - Bootstrap resample the data within each month. Use the `.sample()` to resample the data many times (at least 10,000) with `replace=True`. In doing so, you should create resampled data sets that are the length of the initial data set, calculate the mean and compile the bootstrap resampled means.\n",

    "2. **Were the winds blowing in different directions in January and July?** The 'HLY-WIND-VCTDIR' column provides the vector azimuth\n",
    "    - Make rose diagrams of the wind directions in each month.\n",
    "    - Bootstrap resample the azimuths. Use the `.sample()` to resample the data many times (at least 10,000) with `replace=True`. In doing so, you should create resampled data sets that are the length of the initial data set, calculate the mean and compile the bootstrap resampled means. Remember that calculating a vector mean is different than calculating an arithmetic mean and you should use the approach we took in class to calculate the mean directions for your bootstrap resampled data sets. \n",
