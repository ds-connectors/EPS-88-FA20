    "Your assignment is to conduct spectral analysis on different portions of the Lisecki and Raymo (2005) benthic oxygen isotope ($\\delta ^{18}$O) data from the past 5.32 million years to determine the period of glacial-interglacial cycles. Choose at least **4 different intervals, each >500,000 years long** to look at. A good place to start will be to look at data from the past 800,000 years and compare it to data from the 800,000 to 1,600,000 year (remember 1000 years ago is 1 ka and 1000 ka is a million years)."
