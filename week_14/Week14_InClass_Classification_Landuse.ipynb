Let's display these on the graph using a handy feature of `matplotlib` called `patches` which can be used to draw shapes on a plot. To draw our squares, we're going to import the object `Rectangle()` from `matplotlib.patches`. `Rectangle` takes arguments for the upper left corner, width and height of the rectangle, and the face and edgecolors. We're going to make all our squares 70x70 (4900 training pixels) and label them with `plt.text()`. Let's add our patches and text to our RGB plot above.  To determine the lower left corner, we use the coordinates from the above plot, so 'City' could be x=535,y=550; 'Farms' could be x=165,y=330; 'Water' could be x=315,665; and 'Forest' could be x=780,y=455.

Instead of the words for colors, we can use the RGB color trick whereby each color can range from 0 to 255.  So... 'red' would be \\[255,0,0\\], 'green'  \\[0,255,0\\], and blue \\[0,0,255\\].  White is \\[255,255,255\\], black is \\[0,0,0\\] and grey is half-way in between: \\[125,125,125\\].  "

    "One option is called  [_Principal Component Analysis_](https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/). This is a type of analysis that finds a 2-D projection  of the data that shows the shape of the scatter the most effectively. It does this by grouping dimensions together into _principal components_.  The dimensions `scikit-learn` actually picks to clump together are generally very abstract and hard to relate to any 'real' measurement, but they show the scatter of the data quite nicely. In effect, instead of having to look at lots of different plots, `PCA`  allows us to look at just a single two dimensional plot to see the data. `PCA` is implemented into `scikit-learn` through the `decomposition` module. Let's fit principal components to our training data and see where everything plots."

The [**scikit-learn** website](https://scikit-learn.org) has lots of helpful documentation on how to do this. Importantly, all good machine learning models should be _validated_. This is a kind of check to tell you that the model is producing good results, or if one model is better than another. We did this graphically by looking at our satellite image, but **scikit-learn** provides packages that allow you to do this mathematically.
