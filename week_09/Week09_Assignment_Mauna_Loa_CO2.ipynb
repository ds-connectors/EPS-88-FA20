    "The carbon dioxide data measured on Mauna Loa in Hawaii constitute the longest record of direct measurements of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. They were started by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March of 1958 at a facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Keeling, 1976]. NOAA started its own CO$_2$ measurements in May of 1974, and they have run in parallel with those made by Scripps since then [Thoning, 1989]."
