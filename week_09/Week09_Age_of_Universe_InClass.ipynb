    "The inspiration for today's exercise fame from Lecture 16 of Prof. Lisa Tauxe's [Python for Earth Science Students](https:github.com/ltauxe/Python-for-Earth-Science-Students) class and some of our materials is modified from that lecture.

    "Linear regression is a method for estimating the potential association between two variables. Today, we will use the retreat velocity of galaxies and supernova as a function of their distance as our example data set. Such data underlies what has come to be known as \"Hubble's Law\" (same Hubble as for the Hubble telescope). Hubble published these results in 1929 [Hubble, E. P. (1929) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 15, 168–173.]  At the time, it was unclear whether the universe was static, expanding, or collapsing. Hubble hypothesized that if the universe were expanding, then everything in it would be moving away from us. The greater the distance between the Earth and the galaxy, the faster it must be moving.  So all that had to be done was to measure the distance and velocity of distant galaxies.  Easy-peasy - right?  \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure velocity, Hubble made use of the doppler shift. To understand how this works, recall that the pitch you hear as an ambulance approaches changes. During doppler shift, the ambulance's pitch changes from high (as it approaches) to low (as it recedes). The pitch changes because the relative frequency of the sound waves changes. The frequency increases as the ambulance approaches, leading to a higher pitch, and then decreases as it moves away, resulting in a lower pitch.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The same principle applies to light, but rather than hear a change in frequency, we observe a shift in the wavelength (the color) emitted by the galaxy. If a star or galaxy is moving away from us, its absorption bands are shifted towards longer wavelengths - the red end of the visible spectrum. The faster the star or galaxy travels away from the observer, the greater the shift will be to the red:\n",

In this paper, data are plotted using the parameters $z$ and $\\mu$ which are related to the red shift velocity and distance.  $z$ is the fractional shift in the spectral wavelength and $\\mu$ is related to distance. \n",
